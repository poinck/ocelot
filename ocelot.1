.SH NAME
ocelot \- tiling window manager bundle with side-panel
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ocelot
.RB [ \-v ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I ocelot
is a tiling window manager with a customizable side-panel. It was forked from monsterwm, which seems to be inspired by dwm and catwm.
.P
To start ocelot use the
.I startocelot
script inside your .xinitrc .
.P
.SH MODES
.I ocelot
comes with four tiling layouts by default plus the floating mode.
It allows the usual method of tiling window managers, with the new window as
the master window, but also provides the ability to have the new window opened
as the last window (at the bottom) of the stack.
.P
the available modes:
.TP
.B Tile stack
the stack clients are tiled on the side of master.
.TP
.B Bottom stack
the stack clients are tiled beneath the master.
.TP
.B Grid mode
clients are tiled in a grid, equaly sharing and dividing the screen space
.TP
.B Monocle mode
also known as fullscreen or max mode, where the clients take up the entire
screen space. Other clients are hidden behind the current shown window.
On this layout, fullscreen clients don't need and don't have borders.
You can change that behavior with the
.TP
.B Floating mode
windows can move and be resized freely in the screen space, like on a stacking
window manager. Windows retain their floating status until the user switches
to a tiling mode.
